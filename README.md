# Analysis of country leadersâ€™ economic ideologies through the years

* Analyzed [The Global Leader Ideology dataset](https://github.com/bastianherre/global-leader-ideologies) which provides economic ideologies (leftist, rightist, centrist) of the country leaders in 182 countries, from 1945 to 2020. The dataset has been published by [Bastian Herre](https://www.bastianherre.com/).

* Tried to answer some questions related to the trends, relationships, and clusters in the data by doing data manipulation (with pandas), visualization (with seaborn and plotly), clustering (with scipy), and dimension reduction (with PCA and t-SNE).
